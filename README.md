# OpenSourcePersonality - NN Classifier

**Machine Learning meets Neuroscience** | OpenSourcePersonality is a Classification Neural Network project based on
the Development of the Open Extended Jungian Type Scales published at OpenPsychometrics.org (released under a **Creative 
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License**). 

**Extract from their website**: The Open Extended Jungian Type Scales was developed to be an open source alternative to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The OEJTS was developed by empirically selecting items that differentiated among persons who identified as one of the Myers-Briggs personality types along one of the four dichotomies. 

## Getting Started

Work in progress. Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to expand the dataset. Ensure you save the resulting 
Pandas DataFrame in a csv file using the DataFrame method **DataFrame.to_csv()**

```
>>> output_df.to_csv('my_csv_file.csv')
```

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies in your environment with Pip using the requirements.txt file in your Terminal.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
